# cbox - comment blocks in boxes
cbox allows the user to type in long comments explaining programs, putting in licenses
and describing large sections of source code. It does so by opening up a temporary buffer
for editing. Once finished the comment is inserted and boxed around for pretty
formatting. Comments generated by cbox can be edited once they have been inserted
by calling the same function that created them:
```
cbox-trigger
```
