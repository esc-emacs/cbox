# cbox - comment blocks in boxes
cbox allows the user to type in long comments explaining programs, putting in licenses
and describing large sections of source code. It does so by opening up a temporary buffer
for editing. Once finished the comment is inserted and boxed around for pretty
formatting. Comments generated by cbox can be edited once they have been inserted
by calling the same function that created them:
```
cbox-trigger
```

## How to use cbox
First of all, make sure that `cbox.el` is somewhere in your load path. As an example,
I put elisp files in a `lisp/` folder in `~/.emacs.d/`, obviously make sure you create
that directory with `mkdir ~/.emacs.d/lisp/` and make sure you put this in your `.emacs`
```lisp
;;; Add load path for lisp files
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
```

Now, you need to make sure you load it when needed so put this in your `.emacs`
```lisp
(autoload 'cbox-trigger "cbox" "Comment blocks editing" t)
```

You need to map cbox-trigger to something you like, I like to use `C-c /'
```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c /") 'cbox-trigger)
```
